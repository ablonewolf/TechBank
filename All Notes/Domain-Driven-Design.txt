Domain Driven Design Concept:
    - an approach to structure and model software in a way that it matches the business domain.
    - places the primary focus of a software project on the core area of the business(the core domain).
    - refers to problems as domains and aims to establish a common language to talk about these problems.
    - describes independent problem areas as Bounded Contexts.

Bounded Context:
    - an independent problem area.
    - describes a logical boundary within which a particular model is defined and applicable.
    - each bounded context correlates to a microservice (For example: Bank Account microservice).
